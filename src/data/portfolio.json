I created the front-end with html, css and js. I used three.js to display a 3D model of my logo and animate it with mouse movement. I used php and a json file for the back-end.",

We also had to come up with an idea for a site to create, and we decided to make group member Jade's portfolio, which is Neonprod.uction. I did the design, which is quite simple, on Adobe XD. Then I developed the site in html and css for the front-end, and in php linked to a mysql database for the back-end. Thanks to this site, we got the top mark, 20/20.**This project was carried out during my studies.**",

For the first time, I also used a js library, chart.js, to display the graph. **This project was carried out during my studies.**",

We decided to produce a video telling the story of the theme, made by Jade, quizzes designed by Aur√©line and a virtual escape game designed by Louise. We also chose to implement a general discussion. Personally, I took care of the design, the front-end development in html and css and the back-end development in php linked to a mysql database. This was my first complete project and it enabled me to improve my php skills enormously. I also started using vanilla js thanks to this project, to run the escape game, while discovering dom management. **This project is neither a commercial collaboration nor an order from any company. It was carried out during my studies.**",
