We also had to create an administrator section to manage the questions and answers available. I used html and css for the front-end and php linked to a mysql database for the back-end. For the first time, I also used a js library, chart.js, to display the graph. **This project was carried out during my studies.**",

It's one of the first websites I put online. I used html, css, and php's mail function to create it.",

We decided to produce a video telling the story of the theme, made by Jade, quizzes designed by Aur√©line and a virtual escape game designed by Louise. We also chose to implement a general discussion. Personally, I took care of the design, the front-end development in html and css and the back-end development in php linked to a mysql database. This was my first complete project and it enabled me to improve my php skills enormously. I also started using vanilla js thanks to this project, to run the escape game, while discovering dom management. **This project is neither a commercial collaboration nor an order from any company. It was carried out during my studies.**",
